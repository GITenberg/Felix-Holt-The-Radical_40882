description: A political radical and a child of the working class, Felix has lost
  faith in a political system in which candidates never represent the interests of
  the working class. Harold Transome, the cynical son of wealthy Tory landowners,
  embraces radical politics for very different reasons. Both Harold and Felix vie
  for the affections of Esther Lyon, and she must weigh her feelings for them with
  the social and material goals she has set for herself. Their personal drama unfolds
  against the broad canvas of social and political upheaval of 1830s England.
